# Simulink Fuel Cell Stack V-I and P-I Characteristic Model

This project contains a simple Simulink model and associated MATLAB scripts to simulate and analyze the Voltage-Current (V-I) and Power-Current (P-I) characteristics of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Stack. This serves as a foundational project for understanding hydrogen-based propulsion systems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:
